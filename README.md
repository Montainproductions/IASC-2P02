In the Read me page I will be having the links to my important words with a small explanation on what they do.

## Interactive Study Guide
The project is to create a basic story using Twine and posting 3 diffrent quotes from the story "What is media Archaeology? The Old and the New." by Jussi Parikka. I hav the author of the explanation under each of the explanations to give credit to whoever ended up writing the quote.

## Genealogy on computer monitors
The point of this project was to create a Genealogy of what could of happened if certain things would of changed if parts of a technology didnt get created. So I decided to do two things. First have a brief history on what had actually happened in the real world and then give the three alternatives of history that could of happened. Those being as follows, If no touch screen was invented, if LCD and LED monitors were created making monitors smaller and cheap, or if both of the previous options happened at the same time where there wasent touch screen monitors or LCD/LED monitors on the market.

## Interactive TimeLine
This project is meant so that I create an alternete timeline were a certain technology was/wasent invented and how this affects history and other technological advancments. The thecnology that I choose that Monitors were never created for computers (Or TV for that matter). Through out the time line I have times that tech is invented but instead of being made and used for how its used now in days I have decided to talk about how it would of been used back then and why it was really invented. For example in the alternate timeline the internet was created instead of communicating inbetween people using computers its only purpose is to send information from one computer to another but can only be printed through the recipt so that it can be viewed. Since Monitors never came into existance it also meant that many of the advancments were a few years later then original since it would of taken a bit more to be able to solve the poblems with limited amount of visual aid.

# Speculative Fiction
## May the internet be with you
I had only gotten back from GameStop 30 minutes ago but with how long this dial up service is taking it has felt like a few hours have already passed and I might not be able to play the new Battlefront game with my friends. We have been waiting for this game for months ever since we saw the game trailer while the E3 show was happening on TV. It was amazing watching the revel trailer since both I and my dad have always loved the original movies and have wanted a newer Star Wars game since we played the first one in 2004. 

At this rate I might as well go get something to eat before it’s done so that I don’t want to stop for food while playing. As I come back with the bag of extra buttery Popcorn, I say that the computer was finally connected, and I could start playing with my friends. Once I sat down again, I opened Discord and saw that Jhonny and Alexandria had already joined the voice call, so I joined so that we could start playing as soon as possible.  

Once I joined and heard the distinctive thump sound confirming that I had connected to the call I could hear that they had been talking for a while.  

“Hey guys just joined; sorry I was taking too long just that my internet didn’t want to connect.” Which Jhonny responded quickly; “Hey Mike, Ya it's not a problem I was even just mentioning to Alexandria how I read on this one article of this new type of internet that’s meant to replace the dial up with a faster cable called the Ethernet. This is meant to keep your computer always connected to the internet and it doesn't take forever to connect.” I was surprised about this since I never expected somebody to basically remake the internet service. “Well dam if that's true then that will give us the chance to play more and not worry about having the internet stopping at any point. So shall we start playing or anything else that we should talk about?” 

Alexandria responds, “Not really, join our lobby that we are already in one while we waited for you.” After I joined the lobby, we started to play all the game modes that were in the game but most of them seemed to not be as interesting as we had expected. As we slowly went through all the different game modes, they seemed to be very fun to play but we started to have the most fun when we started to play the multiplayer PVP maps. 

But a problem we started to encounter when playing against other people was that clearly our dial up internets weren't meant to handle the speeds that were required when playing an online game like Battlefield. The most frustrating time was when I had recently gotten my hands on the playable character of Darth Vader and moments later my internet decided not to want to work and wanted to restart and have the internet re-dial in before I could use it again. This was frustrating and after having this already happened to Alexandria previously in the first few games, I was tired of trying to reconnect from each other's games and decided to take a break and instead of using the internet. At this point I might as well just call Jhonny and see if he wants to work on school stuff and maybe even talk about that new internet format he had mentioned before we started playing earlier today since it's not as much fun playing the game if we must wait like 30 minutes each time the internet falls or somebody decides to call from the house.

## Micro Essay

For the short story one of the main ideas was to see the effects of having one piece of media be stuck in the past while everything else moved on with its normal course until 2015. The plan was to have people only having the option of having dial up internet while having new and more advanced games and computers that people could use in their everyday life. An example of this in the short story would be how when Mike is able to connect to the internet through his dial up internet after around 30 – 40 minutes of waiting he first joins discord so that he can talk with his friends. This use of old media in the form of dial up internet while also being able to use newer media like discord. A similar comparison would be for the vinyl group in Londen that meets up to listen in silence to music on a vinyl record decides to get an album from a more recent band and decide to play in one of their meetings. At the same time another type of zombie media that I use in the short story is the Star Wars franchise. Even though in the real world it is a franchise that is still very popular even 34 years after the first movie it is for that reason that it can relate to what Jussi Parikka said in his article, “New Media might be here and slowly changing our user habits, but old media never left us. They are continuously remediated, resurfacing, finding new uses, contexts, adaptations.” This couldn’t be truer with Star Wars since there have been 3 different trilogies released, 3 different tv series (2 animated one live action) and countless games that have been released.
